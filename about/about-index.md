## berzerk0's About Me

![hi](../images/avatar.png)

Hello!

My name is Ben, I live in NYC, and I've worked in penetration testing for a while now.

This term is often interchangeable with "Ethical Hacker," but that's like saying "non-embezzling accountant."
It also kind of makes people giggle.

I'm committed to keeping my hat white and helping people understand and mitigate real-world problems.

It's fascinating how technology can start out as a flash of inspiration and end up impacting people's lives. But it's not without its risks, and it's important that we stay ahead of them as much as possible.

Check out my projects and writings linked at the top and bottom of this page. You can also find me on twitter at [@berzerk0](https://twitter.com/berzerk0).
