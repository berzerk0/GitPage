### Projects and Tools
* [Probable Wordlists](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists) - Up to 20GB of passwords, sorted by popularity. Make sure your passwords aren't popular! Completely overhauled version 2 released.

* [BEWGor](https://github.com/berzerk0/BEWGor) - __Bull's Eye Wordlist Generator:__ Does your password rely on predictable patterns of accessible info?

* (Currently Non-Operational) [@WorstPasswords](https://twitter.com/WorstPasswords) - Twitter bot inspired by [@redteamwrangler](https://twitter.com/redteamwrangler) that tweets out one of the world's most common 747 passwords twice a day. [More info](https://github.com/berzerk0/GitPage/wiki/%40WorstPasswords-Twitter-Bot).

These projects have gained some attention and has been mentioned in articles, a podcast, and even a book! I'd like to return the favor.

### Other
