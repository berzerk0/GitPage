These projects have gained some attention and has been mentioned in articles, a podcast, and even a book! I'd like to return the favor.

### Other

* OSINT Work - Open-Source Intelligence is fascinating to me. I've helped out a few friends by demonstrating what I was able to find on them based on a piece of seed information like an email address - all with their informed consent, of course. [Here is an example](images/osint.png).


* [RIGA-38-Hydrant](http://pasted.co/96db820a) - A cryptography, steganography, and OSINT CTF-Like group of challenges. 25 in all.  One day I will find a better home for these, but for now they are at pasted.co. Just for fun.
